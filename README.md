# Operating Systems Lab Projects

This repository contains a collection of operating systems lab projects that demonstrate various core concepts in operating system design and implementation. Each lab focuses on a different aspect of operating systems, from kernel programming to file systems.

## Lab Overview

### [Lab 0: A Kernel Seedling](lab0/README.md)
A Linux kernel module that creates a `/proc/count` file to display the total number of running processes in the system. This lab introduces basic kernel programming concepts including procfs entries and system information access.

### [Lab 1: Pipe Up](lab1/lab1/README.md)
A command-line tool that implements process pipelines, demonstrating inter-process communication through pipes. This lab covers process creation, pipe communication, and command execution in Unix-like systems.

### [Lab 2: You Spin Me Round Robin](lab2/README.md)
A Round Robin process scheduler simulator that demonstrates CPU scheduling algorithms. The implementation calculates average waiting and response times for processes, showcasing fundamental scheduling concepts.

### [Lab 3: Hash Hash Hash](lab3/README.md)
A thread-safe hash table implementation that explores different locking strategies for concurrent access. This lab demonstrates synchronization mechanisms and their impact on performance in multi-threaded environments.

### [Lab 4: Hey! I'm Filing Here](lab4/README.md)
A file system simulator that implements various file system operations including file creation, deletion, and metadata management. This lab covers file system concepts like allocation strategies and directory management.
